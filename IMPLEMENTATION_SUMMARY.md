# StoreHub Merchant Onboarding Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the StoreHub merchant onboarding system, including the backend API, frontend interface, and deployment configuration.

## System Architecture

### Backend (NestJS)
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for managers, token-based access for merchants
- **Deployment**: Render.com with automatic deployments

### Frontend (React)
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks and local storage
- **Deployment**: Render.com static site

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication System
- **Manager Authentication**: JWT-based login with Google OAuth integration
- **Merchant Access**: Token-based access without passwords
- **Protected Routes**: Role-based access control

### 2. Onboarding Management
- **Create Onboarding Records**: Managers can create new merchant onboarding records
- **Merchant Self-Service**: Merchants can view and schedule their onboarding steps
- **Progress Tracking**: Multi-step process with delivery, installation, and training phases

### 3. Training Slot Management
- **Trainer Management**: Create and manage trainers with location and language preferences
- **Slot Booking**: Automatic trainer assignment using round-robin algorithm
- **Availability Checking**: Real-time slot availability based on trainer schedules

### 4. Business Rules Implementation
- **Working Day Calculations**: Excludes weekends and Malaysian public holidays
- **Date Validation**: Ensures proper sequencing of delivery → installation → training
- **Minimum Lead Times**: Enforces business rules for scheduling gaps

## Recent Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Training Booking Race Condition Fix (Latest)
**Problem**: Merchants experienced inconsistent booking states where training appeared unbooked after errors but showed as booked after re-login.

**Root Cause**: The `handleTrainingConfirm` function updated the onboarding record with `trainingConfirmed: true` before attempting to book the training slot. When booking failed, the backend record was already marked as confirmed, but the frontend state wasn't updated, causing inconsistency.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Frontend Changes** (`frontend/src/pages/MerchantSchedulePage.tsx`):
   - Reordered `handleTrainingConfirm` to book training slot BEFORE marking as confirmed
   - Training confirmation only happens after successful slot booking
   - Prevents race condition between frontend state and backend record updates

2. **Backend Changes** (`backend/src/trainer/training-schedule.service.ts`):
   - Added check in `bookTrainingSlotWithAutoAssign` to prevent duplicate bookings
   - Returns existing slot if onboarding record already has a booked training slot
   - Includes onboarding relation in query for proper data mapping

**Impact**: Eliminates inconsistent states where merchants see different booking statuses before and after re-login.

### Training Date Business Rule Enforcement
**Problem**: Training could be scheduled on the same day as installation, violating business rules.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `getMinTrainingDate()` to use `hardwareInstallationDate` instead of `installationConfirmedDate`
- Added `isTrainingDateValid()` validation function
- Enhanced date picker with `getTrainingDisabledDays()` to disable invalid dates

### Training Slot Availability Checking
**Problem**: System showed all time slots without checking trainer availability.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `MobileDatePicker` with `checkSlotAvailability()` function
- Only shows time slots with available trainers matching location, language, training type
- Provides meaningful error messages for different scenarios

### Merchant Authentication Fix
**Problem**: Merchants redirected to login page on booking failures instead of seeing error messages.

**Solution**:
- Fixed API service to handle both `authToken` (managers) and `merchantAccessToken` (merchants)
- Prevented automatic login redirect for merchant users on 401 errors
- Improved error handling with guidance to contact onboarding manager

## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Onboarding**: Main record with merchant details and scheduling information
- **OnboardingManager**: User accounts for managers
- **Trainer**: Trainer profiles with location and language capabilities
- **TrainingSlot**: Booked training sessions with trainer assignments

### Key Relationships
- Onboarding belongs to OnboardingManager (created by)
- TrainingSlot belongs to Trainer and Onboarding
- Round-robin assignment ensures fair trainer workload distribution

## API Endpoints

### Manager Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Manager authentication
- `GET /api/onboarding` - List all onboarding records
- `POST /api/onboarding` - Create new onboarding record
- `GET /api/trainers` - Manage trainers
- `GET /api/training-schedules` - View all training schedules

### Merchant Endpoints
- `GET /api/onboarding/by-token/:token` - Get onboarding details by access token
- `PUT /api/onboarding/by-token/:token` - Update onboarding record
- `POST /api/merchant-training-schedules/book-auto-assign` - Book training slot
- `GET /api/training-slots/available` - Check slot availability
- `GET /api/schedule/holidays/:year` - Get public holidays

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Database connection strings
- JWT secrets
- Google OAuth credentials
- API base URLs

### Render.com Services
- Backend: Node.js service with PostgreSQL database
- Frontend: Static site with automatic builds
- Environment-specific configurations

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Complete Onboarding Flow**: Manager creates → Merchant schedules → Training booked
2. **Error Handling**: No trainers available, invalid dates, expired tokens
3. **Business Rules**: Date validation, working day calculations
4. **Authentication**: Manager and merchant access patterns

### Production Monitoring
- Error tracking through application logs
- Database performance monitoring
- User experience validation

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Trainer Management**: Limited to basic CRUD operations
2. **Notification System**: No automated email/SMS notifications
3. **Reporting**: Basic listing views without advanced analytics
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive but not native mobile app

### Planned Improvements
1. **Enhanced Notifications**: Email/SMS alerts for scheduling updates
2. **Advanced Reporting**: Dashboard with metrics and analytics
3. **Calendar Integration**: Sync with Google Calendar/Outlook
4. **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android applications
5. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for different markets
